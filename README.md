An exceptional piece of work that shows careful attention to detail.

My first major project written in C. I enjoyed the challenges that arose from programming in something more syntactically modern than Assembly but without the bells and whistles of modern languages like C#/JS etc.
This project allowed me to optimise small pieces of code to run in just a few instructions. Something not really possible through the abstraction of a modern language. The project was a challenge but I am happy to have achieved well beyond the requirements of the project. 

Because of this project, I've developed a keen interest in low level programming for operating systems and similar, and hope to work on either this project or similar in the future.
